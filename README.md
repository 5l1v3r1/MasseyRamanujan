# MasseyRamanujan

The Ramanujan Machine is an algorithmic approach to discover new mathematical conjectures. For the time being, the project is focused in number theory, specifically on finding formulas relating fundamental constants like pi and e to various continued fractions. For more information, please go to [RamanujanMachine.com](https://www.RamanujanMachine.com).

## Installation

Clone the repo and install the requirements in the requirements.txt file. If you have pip, it can be done by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
That's it, you are ready to discover new conjectures.

## Running the code

Under the source/ folder,
```python
python enumerate_over_gcf.py
```
runs the code.
